  <h3>Did you want to upload/share a code/config/log file?</h3>
  <p>Please use the <a href=https://pastes.dev/>https://pastes.dev/</a> frontend (or <a href=https://github.com/lucko/paste/blob/master/API.md>API</a>) instead! It is maintained by the same author (me!) and much better for that purpose than this site ever was. :)
  <h3>Did you want to use bytebin for your app?</h3>
  <p>Depending on what you're after, the <a href=https://pastes.dev/>pastes.dev</a> 'official' service may be a good fit. Please have a read the <a href=https://github.com/lucko/paste/blob/master/API.md>API documentation</a> and the Terms of Service, and proceed with that if it is!
  <p>Otherwise, please self-host your own instance of bytebin. The <a href=https://github.com/lucko/bytebin>bytebin GitHub page</a> has some basic instructions.
  <p>Please <strong>do not</strong> use this (https://bytebin.lucko.me) service.

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>This service (https://bytebin.lucko.me) was originally created in 2018, and was used primarily for my own personal projects. Some others asked for permission to use it too, and I generally allowed that on a case-by-case basis. Many others have also used it without permission. Fast-forward to today, my personal projects are using different solutions, and this service is now defunct.
  <p>It only exists today for backwards compatibility with some of my older projects, and to allow users time to migrate to other solutions. It will be permanently turned off soon. In the meantime, if you come across any projects that are still using this service or referencing the <code>https://bytebin.lucko.me</code> URL, please consider letting the author know that they should migrate to a different solution.
  <h3>Report Abuse</h3>
  <p>If you come across any content on this service that is malicious or illegal, please <a href=https://lucko.me/contact>get in touch with me</a> (by email) so I can delete it.</p><br>
  <p>Thank you :)
